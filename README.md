Jarvis-v2.0
===========

This is a major update of my project JARVIS-The-Ultimate-Project. You can check out my first project here [JARVIS-The-Ultimate-Project](https://github.com/JoelShine/JARVIS-The-Ultimate-Project). Made many changes and this is better than the previous version. Also included Speech Recognition and a very own **Launchpad** like Apples's Launchpad in Mac.

## About this project

- Speech Recognition module for better usage of the assistant.
