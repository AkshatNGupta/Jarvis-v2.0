Jarvis-v2.0
===========

This is a major update of my project JARVIS-The-Ultimate-Project. You can check out my first project here [JARVIS-The-Ultimate-Project](https://github.com/JoelShine/JARVIS-The-Ultimate-Project). Made many changes and this is better than the previous version. Also included Speech Recognition and a very own **Launchpad** like Apples's Launchpad in Mac.

## About this project

This project is an example of a virtual assistant like **Siri**, **Cortana**, **Google Assistant** etc. A virtual assistant helps us to control the computer more efficiently and faster. It will be a great experience using Jarvis-v2.0 as it includes a great deal of modules to control the computer. Note that there is both a male voice version and female voice version for jarvis.
